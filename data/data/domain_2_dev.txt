You Can Turn No Into Yes and Other Lessons Learned
This week, the country had a national teach-in about domestic violence courtesy of a grainy elevator video showing Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancée Janay Palmer. The dark, disturbing images sparked the soul-searching coast-to-coast conversation this issue deserves. In the two days after the video's release, calls to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline shot up 84 percent. And while some shamefully implied that victims who stay in abusive relationships are somehow culpable for their abuse, the hashtag #WhyIStayed, begun by Beverly Gooden, provided a harrowing array of deeply poignant answers. Though questions remain about what NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell knew and when he knew it, it's clear this issue goes far beyond the NFL. Ray Rice is just the tip of the iceberg -- beneath it lies a culture and legal system that perpetuates this kind of violence in millions of cases that we never see.

Why does a season that's supposed to be about happiness and joy so often result in just the opposite? A survey by Consumer Reports found that 90 percent of Americans find at least one thing stressful about the holiday season (who are these 10 percent who feel no holiday stress?). Of course, it's possible that just having such expectations of the season to begin with, and then feeling the guilt at not meeting them, might be part of the problem. But whatever the reason, stress is what a lot of people will be unwrapping this year. Fortunately, much of it is returnable. So what follows are tips not only for holiday stress, but for the rest of the year as well. If you're in that 90 percent who's stressed out this week and next, this might be the list you should be checking twice. Your mind and body -- as well as your family -- will thank you.

What is Elizabeth Warren up to? Elizabeth Warren's offhand remark in an interview with People magazine strongly suggested that the Massachusetts senator has revised her previous firm declarations of non-candidacy for president and is now deliberately leaving the door open a crack. Asked whether she was considering a run in 2016, Warren said disarmingly, "I don't think so," but added, "If there's any lesson I've learned in the last five years, it's don't be so sure about what lies ahead. There are amazing doors that could open." That sure opened one door. Is Warren really thinking about challenging frontrunner Hillary Clinton? I'd be surprised if Warren has made any decision on that question, but her remark immediately set off two kinds of political waves.

This week was dominated by news from Ferguson -- but much of what was really happening went untold by the media. While TV viewers were mostly presented with endless images of tear gas, violence and division, a fuller depiction would have revealed a community challenged by adversity, underrepresentation and institutional failure that responded with remarkable empathy, kindness and trust. At HuffPost, in addition to covering the protests, the failure of those sworn to serve the citizens of Ferguson, and the entrenched role of race, we also tried to shine a light on how the community came together -- cleaning up, handing out food, and raising money. There was a lot more love than looting in Ferguson, more compassion than conflict. How the media covers a crisis matters -- and showing only one side breeds cynicism about what we can become. The brave citizens of Ferguson have risen to the occasion. I hope the media will join them.

Donald Trump's Tax Cuts Would Cause Deficit To Explode, Report Says
This week the nation entered terra incognita, as Indiana GOP voters handed Donald Trump a big victory, giving us -- with Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropping out -- the most unqualified, unstable, and dangerous nominee in U.S. history. The events immediately provided a test for Republicans, some of whom rose to the occasion and refused to endorse Trump. Then there was Rick Perry, who once called Trump a "cancer." Now? He says he'd consider being his running mate: "I will be open to any way I can help. I'm not going to say no." What stirring statesmanship. But this is not just a test for the GOP. It's also a test for the media, who, as David Roberts writes, is likely to give a very unusual campaign the usual media treatment: "Trump's obvious unfitness for office -- today widely acknowledged across both parties and in the mainstream media -- will become a partisan observation." So, yes, as the media writes about how various Republicans are handling their character test, we need to remember we're facing one ourselves. The most important mistake the media could make now would be to treat this like a normal election, and Donald Trump like a normal candidate.

This week Donald Trump crossed the delegate threshold he needs to secure the Republican nomination. And the nation crossed the danger threshold of electing the most unstable, unready and extreme president in U.S. history. But not to worry, says Paul Manafort. In an interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman, the Trump campaign manager assures us Trump will show America he can "fill the chair." And that ban on Muslims? "He's already started moderating on that," Manafort said. "He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he'll soften it some more." The problem is that softened racism, xenophobia and misogyny are no less dangerous. Though the media, which has already retreated to horserace coverage, won't call Trump out, others will. Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of the late Vince Foster, spoke up about Trump's airing of conspiracy theories about her brother's death.

An article in the New York Times last Wednesday, titled "An Apple a Day, and Other Myths," is perpetuating the misconception that diet does not affect cancer risk. This article calls potential connections between high-nutrient foods and cancer "nutritional folklore," and does a great disservice to the American people, discouraging efforts toward improving one's health and quality of life.
"Having it all" seems to have died a slow and unceremonious death. Now we American women talk about blending, integration, "managing it all", or giving it all up in favor of digital detox, yoga and a simpler life. Less stuff, less stress, and less enterprising women in the workforce using their unique voices to challenge the fundamentally broken status quo.
This was a week that saw the return of former leaders with less than successful results. In the World Cup, Spain fell 2-0 to Chile, knocking the defending champions out even before the upcoming knockout rounds. In an even worse reappearance, former Vice President Dick Cheney appeared on Fox News to defend his assertion that President Obama has "been so wrong about so much." But host Megyn Kelly scored a surprise knockout herself when she said, "History has proven that you got it wrong as well in Iraq, sir." As they say: 'Goooooooal!' Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Patent Office canceled several trademarks on the name "Washington Redskins." Though D.C.'s football team hasn't changed its mascot yet, if they do, I'm partial to renaming them the Washington Drones. Other suggestions that came my way on Twitter include the Watergators, the Lobbyists, the Super PACers, the Gerrymanders, the Filibusters and the Weasels. Tough to choose when they all seem so apt.

Elizabeth Warren To Campaign For Jeff Merkley In Oregon
This week, the nation was reminded, in ways both good and bad, that elections matter. On Monday, a Supreme Court that will likely see multiple appointments from the next president delivered a landmark decision for reproductive rights. On Tuesday, terrorists bombed the Istanbul airport, leaving 42 dead. Right on cue, Donald Trump reminded the world why judgment and stability matter, repeating his call for more torture, saying "you have to fight fire with fire." And so, as the fallout from Brexit continues in the U.K., more Republican officials here are beating the drums for Trexit, separating themselves from the toxic menace that is Trump. Utah Senator Mike Lee said he won't vote for Trump without assurances he won't "abuse" the Constitution, and Maine Senator Susan Collins hinted she might vote for Hillary Clinton, while Mitt Romney said he'd vote for his wife before Trump. Meanwhile, Illinois Senator Mark Kirk became the first GOP incumbent to air an anti-Trump ad. As the list of Trexiting elected officials grows, so does the #NeverTrump RNC effort to insert a "conscience clause" allowing delegates to vote against a candidate who violates their moral beliefs. As the convention nears, we're finding out whose conscience puts country above party -- and whose does not.

This week, our nation paused to give thanks -- a ritual that, when done regularly, has been scientifically proven to increase happiness. And if we make it a habit, we can get the benefits without the offsetting headaches of that dreaded modern malady, Black Friday.

As we all pause for thanks, we should also stop to reflect on what happened in Ferguson, where a grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown. Although some of the particulars of the case may be in dispute, the fact remains that Brown was an unarmed black teenager gunned down in the street by a police officer -- yet another victim of the profound racial divide plaguing our justice system. As Brown's devastated family said in a statement: "We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen."

This week, a world facing crises on many fronts rang in Christmas. Though this is traditionally a season of good cheer, in his holiday address at the Vatican, Pope Francis showed it could also be a time of sober reflection. The often good-humored pontiff delivered a somber message of concern for abused children, refugees, and victims of violence and war. The speech was similar in tone to his annual message to the cardinals, bishops, and priests who run the Vatican, delivered earlier in the week, in which the Pope decried 15 "ailments of the Curia." These included "careerism and opportunism," "social exhibitionism," and "spiritual Alzheimer's," seen in those who "become enslaved to the idols that they have built with their own hands." His words stand as a worthy challenge to us all to combat indifference and tap into the better angels of our nature -- no matter what religious tradition you may follow (including none at all).
